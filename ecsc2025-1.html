        <h1>Introduction!</h1>
<p>In this post and another I will show my writeup for 2 challenges that was present in the ECSC 2025 CTF</p>

<p>CTF challenges are like mental marathons—complex, frustrating, and deeply satisfying once you solve them. This CTF was about SSTI vulnerability I exploited in a FastAPI app. Let me break it down for you in a way that’s a bit more… human.</p>

<h2>The code</h2>
<p>The app I was working with was built using FastAPI, with a backend connected to MySQL. The app allowed users to create accounts, view a list of users, and display bios. There was a special “test” user that you couldn’t mess with <span>import uuid
    import uvicorn
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from typing import Optional
    from fastapi import Response, Request, FastAPI, HTTPException
    from jinja2 import Template
    import mysql.connector
    
    cnx_pool = mysql.connector.pooling.MySQLConnectionPool(
        host="mysql",
        port=3306,
        user="user",
        password="user",
        database="db",
        pool_size=32,
        pool_name="pool",
        use_pure=True,
    )
    
    @dataclass
    class User:
        username: Optional[str] = uuid.uuid4()
        bio: Optional[str] = "default bio"
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.middleware("http")
    async def get_db_connection(request: Request, call_next):
        response = Response("Internal server error", status_code=500)
        request.state.db = cnx_pool.get_connection()
        try:
            response = await call_next(request)
        finally:
            request.state.db.close()
        return response
    
    @app.post("/users/")
    def create_user(request: Request, user: User):
        if user.username != "test":
            cursor = request.state.db.cursor()
            session_id = uuid.uuid4()
            cursor.execute(
                "insert into users (username, bio, session_id) values (%s,%s,%s)",
                [user.username, user.bio, str(session_id)],
            )
            request.state.db.commit()
            return session_id
        else:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Can't modify the test user!")
    
    @app.get("/users/")
    def get_users(request: Request, session_id: Optional[str] = None):
        cursor = request.state.db.cursor()
        query = "select username, bio, (username='test') as matched from users where (session_id is NULL or session_id=%s)"
        cursor.execute(query, [session_id])
        found = [
            f"Welcome {username}, {bio}!"
            for (username, bio, matched) in cursor
            if matched != False
        ]
        return Template("\n".join(found)).render()
    
    @app.get("/")
    def index():
        return "You can't connect to this API with your browser. Check the source code."
    </span></p>


<h2>SQLi?</h2>
<p>So, when I started diving into the app, I immediately thought SQL Injection (SQLi) was the way in. The application interacts with a MySQL database, so it seemed like an obvious vector. I looked at the create_user endpoint first: <span>cursor.execute(
    "insert into users (username, bio, session_id) values (%s,%s,%s)",
    [user.username, user.bio, str(session_id)],
)</span></p>

<p>I noticed they were using parameterized queries—which is good practice to prevent SQLi. No dice here. SQLi was out of the picture. At this point. But the username field was still a bit suspicious because it was being rendered directly to a page. Maybe there’s another angle? I started thinking Server-Side Template Injection.</p>

<h2>I know what I'm doing... Trust me!</h2>
<p>When I reviewed the <code>get_users</code> endpoint, I saw something interesting: <span>return Template("\n".join(found)).render()</span>
</p>
<p>The jinja2 template was being used to render the list of users. This immediately raised a red flag. Jinja2 templates can allow for code execution if user input is improperly sanitized. Could I inject something into the username field and cause some unintended behavior? I decided to try injecting some basic <strong>{{7*7}}</strong> Jinja2 expressions into the username field and see if I could get something to execute.</p>
<p>I've tried injecting as a username, and then with <strong>session_id</strong> get that user onto the screen. <span>POST /users/ { "username": "{{7*7}}", "bio": "test bio" }</span></p>
<p>But the SQL query that was showing the user info was written to show only the test user.</p>
<h2>Homoglyphs?????</h2>
<p>I started thinking, how can I bypass the test user modification restriction? I remembered that homoglyphs (characters that look similar to other characters) and Punycode (used for encoding non-ASCII characters) could be a way to sneak past filtering mechanisms. Worth a shot. But again I was wrong. homoglyphs and Punycode weren't the answer.</p>
<h2>The final answer.</h2>
<p>After a while it was time to use my special weapon. A <strong>SPACE</strong>... following username with a space helped me bypass the "You can't modify the test user". Sending POST request to the /users/ endpoint with:
<span>{
"username":"test ",
"bio":"{{7*7}}"
}</span>
gived me a <em>session_id</em> which I can next pass as an argument in GET request to the same endpoint:
<span>GET /users/?session_id=3fe9c355-65f0-4667-b05f-5023d2f1df9f
</span>
this request returned: <bold style="color: red;">
    "Welcome test, test bio!\nWelcome test , 49!"</bold>
    BINGO! Now all I need to do is perform an RCE to gain full control. ^^
